                    <p><big><strong>Hi
                                we’re </strong></big><strong><big>ellaslist</big></strong><big><strong>,</strong></big></p>
                    <p>Thanks for checking us out.&nbsp;We're a movement of mums and dads just like you who love getting the
                        most out of their neighbourhoods and having amazing new experiences with their kids.</p>
                    <p>We know raising kids is no mean feat and we need ton of inspiration. So we spend time discovering the
                        best local kid-friendly events, classes,&nbsp;places to go and cool stuff to help you rock at this
                        parenting gig.</p>
                    <p>We believe in discovering something new every day and we know that opening your child’s world can
                        open yours,&nbsp;too.</p>
                    <p>We know that getting out and about can perk you up more than a&nbsp;macchiato, a five-minute chat can
                        turn your whole day around and&nbsp;connectivity is more than a strong WiFi signal.</p>
                    <p>And, guess what? We’ve found your community, just around the corner.</p>
                    <p>So we help make it&nbsp;happen, hooking you up with the best of what’s on around you and more.</p>
                    <p><big><strong>Our Purpose</strong></big></p>
                    <p>We&nbsp;understand the impact that having strong community connections can make when you have kids.&nbsp;By
                        making discovery easier at a hyper-local level, we help families make stronger connections in their
                        local 'villages' which help break social barriers and parenthood isolation.&nbsp;You'll discover
                        things you didn't know about, &nbsp;try new things, spend a little less time in front of a screen
                        and&nbsp;build more&nbsp;support networks.</p>
                    <p><big><strong>Our Story</strong></big></p>
                    <p>We started out in 2010 with just one mum – Yvette – and her baby daughter, Ella. Yvette wanted to
                        discover and enjoy the best bits of her local community with Ella, and connect with other mums. But
                        back then there was no curated family-friendly local guide for mums. So Yvette created ellaslist.&nbsp;Today,
                        more than 300,000 parents across Sydney &amp; Melbourne choose&nbsp;ellaslist every month to find
                        the best things to do with kids, get ideas for days out, and discover new places to go.&nbsp;We
                        personally review (as many as we can) the best&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;events and activities for&nbsp;families
                        - so you know what kind of experience you're getting and we'll share our practical insider tips and
                        stuff worth knowing about.</p>
